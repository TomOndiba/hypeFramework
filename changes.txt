1.8.1 -> 1.8.2

- New input types:
    -- Entity Icon (entity_icon) : file input to add an icon to entities created through hjform
    -- Relationship Tags (relationship_tags) : autcomplete tagging input to add custom relationships between an entity being created and other entities of defined type, subtype, meta

- New JS vendor libraries:
    -- jsTree

- Changed handling of dropdown outputs. Values echoed as "{$field_name}:value:{$field_value}"

- Added sticky form support to hjForm entities


1.8.2 -> 1.8.5

- Entities lib helper functions were getting too complicated and unsable, so reworked the entire handling of params.
Now all params that need to be attached to a url can be passed via vars to the view
Added additional parameters handled by the js, including 'dom_order' (append|prepend), 'source' and 'target', 'box_x' and 'fbox_y'
- Changed elgg.action() to form.ajaxSubmit() to handle file uploads in a pseudo-live manner
- Changed handling of some JS files, including the editor
- Removed the actual dompdf library. Can still be uploaded independently to enable pdf capabilities
- Removed FirePHP library, as it was more of a development tool
- Moved hjAnnotation class from hypeAlive to hypeFramework
- Introduced ajaxed pagination (show more) mechanism

1.8.5 - 1.8.6

- Fixed major simplecache regeneration bug (thanks to Mark Griffiths for reporting and helping debug)
- Fixed missing provision for ElggAnnotations in lists (thanks to Matt Beckett for the fix)

- JS/CSS:
	-- Introduced JS framework object to store and manipulate data client-side
	-- Deprecated a number of redundant CSS styles
	-- Introduced on-demand JS/CSS loading for AJAX calls

- Lists:
	-- Brand new framework for rendering lists (list filtering, real-time updates)

- Forms:
	-- Refactored the code to generate forms from config array. Regeneration is triggered when the the final value of 'forms:config', 'framework:forms' hook changes
	-- Added support for user function for 'value', 'options', 'options_values' hjField attributes - gradually moving away from eval()

- Location:
	-- Added geocoding support for all entities that have 'location' metadata


1.8.6 - 1.8.7 (in progress)
- Deprecating hjForm and hjField classes in favour of an hjDynamicForm class
